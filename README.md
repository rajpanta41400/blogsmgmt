General Overview:

A blog website with the use of technologies like nodejs, expressjs and mongodb.

Features:
1)Home page
2)Users can view blogs without logging in.
3) Admin panel for user to create, edit and delete the blogs. (For admin acess, you should go to "home url" + "/admin" )
4) Interactive UI

Problems:
1) There is no use of React since I have no prior knowledge of it. So I focused on html/css. (For css, I referenced a lot from the templates in the internet).
2) There is no use of Jest and other testing libraries.
